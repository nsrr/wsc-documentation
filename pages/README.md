# About

The [Wisconsin Sleep Cohort (WSC)](https://pophealth.wisc.edu/research/the-wisconsin-sleep-cohort/) is an ongoing longitudinal study of the causes, consequences, and natural history of sleep disorders, particularly sleep apnea. The WSC uses overnight in-laboratory sleep studies (in-patient studies at the University of Wisconsin - Madison ICTR's CTRC) conducted with a baseline sample of 1,500 Wisconsin state employees, assessed at four-year intervals.

With approximately 100 publications, the WSC study has produced seminal findings on the wide prevalence of sleep apnea; the longitudinal association of sleep apnea with cardiovascular, mental health, and mortality outcomes; and risk factors for sleep disorders including weight gain, the menopausal transition, and alcohol use. The WSC also maintains multiple national and international collaborations related to basic science and population-level sleep research, including partnerships with groups at Stanford, the University of Chicago, Harvard, Toronto, the UK, Poland, France, and others.

The National Sleep Research Resource is grateful to the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort for sharing these data.

## Data preamble and access restrictions

Wisconsin Sleep Cohort data available on NSRR represent a limited portion of all potentially available Wisconsin Sleep Cohort data. Some Wisconsin Sleep Cohort data are presently withheld from NSRR due to one or more of the following: 1) constraints on sharing due to some participants refusing data sharing options at the point of obtaining informed consent; 2) data are being used to address currently-funded projects; 3) data have not yet been prepared for sharing; 4) data are not available in an electronically-sharable format (e.g., "old-school" paper-based polysomnographic recordings); 5) miscellaneous other reasons. Please contact Amanda Rasmuson (arasmuson@wisc.edu) if there are questions.  
 
Wisconsin Sleep Cohort data available on NSRR may be used for non-commercial use only. Requests for data use will be approved exclusively for sleep related research. Additional variables and data may be requested and obtained directly from the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study (please contact Amanda Rasmuson: arasmuson@wisc.edu).

Please keep these guidelines in mind when [starting your WSC data request](https://sleepdata.org/data/requests/wsc/start).
