## About

The [Wisconsin Sleep Cohort (WSC)](https://pophealth.wisc.edu/research/the-wisconsin-sleep-cohort/) was a longitudinal, observational study conducted from 1988 to 2019, designed to investigate the prevalence, causes, and consequences of sleep disorders in adults. The study employed a two-stage sampling design to over-sample individuals at high risk for sleep apnea. All employees aged 30 to 60 years who worked for four large state agencies were surveyed about their sleep patterns and other characteristics by a mailed questionnaire. The timeline includes Survey 1 (1988-1993), Survey 2 (1994), and Survey 3 (2000-2001). Data from six question responses from Survey 1 were used to classify survey participants as high risk and low risk for sleep apnea to be invited to participate in the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study. The study recruited 1,500 individuals aged 30–60, initially free of major health conditions, and followed them through repeated overnight in-lab polysomnography (PSG) studies and questionnaires approximately every four years. The primary aim was to examine sleep-disordered breathing, particularly sleep apnea, and its association with a range of health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, metabolic dysfunction, and mental health disorders.

Participants underwent full-night PSG following American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) scoring criteria, allowing for detailed assessments of sleep architecture, oxygen saturation, and respiratory events. The study also collected comprehensive data on lifestyle factors, weight changes, menopausal transition, and alcohol use to explore risk factors for sleep disorders. Key findings from the WSC have been published in approximately 100 papers, highlighting the broad prevalence of sleep apnea and its long-term health impacts. The study has provided critical insights into how sleep disorders contribute to morbidity and mortality across the lifespan.

## Methods

### **Recruitment and Eligibility:**

The study recruited participants through a two-stage sampling scheme. In the first stage, state employees aged 30 to 60 from four large Wisconsin state agencies were surveyed via a mailed questionnaire (**Mailed Survey 1**) about their sleep patterns. In the second stage, survey participants were classified as high or low risk for sleep apnea based on their responses to six survey questions. High-risk individuals were sampled at 100%, while low-risk individuals were sampled at a 1:1.5 (High/Low Risk) ratio within sex-stratified 2-year age groups. Exclusion criteria included being currently pregnant, recent upper airway surgery, tracheostomy, recent cancer surgery, or unstable cardiopulmonary disease.

### Clinical Visit

Clinical visits for the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort (WSC) involve thorough preparation and detailed assessments. Before the visit, participants may be asked to maintain a sleep diary and follow specific instructions, such as avoiding alcohol, caffeine, or certain medications on the day of the study. The overnight sleep studies are conducted at the University of Wisconsin–Madison Institute for Clinical and Translational Research's (ICTR) Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC), where participants arrive in the evening and stay overnight in a private room designed for comfort. During the study, polysomnography is performed, involving electrodes to measure brain activity, eye movements, muscle activity, heart rate, and oxygen levels, as well as monitoring of breathing effort and airflow. Additional assessments may include questionnaires on health and sleep habits, as well as medical tests such as blood draws, weight and height measurements, and blood pressure checks. After the visit, the collected data are analyzed to evaluate sleep disorders, particularly sleep apnea, and significant findings may be shared with participants if follow-up is needed.

### PSG Collection

The Wisconsin Sleep Cohort (WSC) study employs full-night polysomnography (PSG) to assess sleep patterns and disorders among participants. Conducted at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Clinical and Translational Research Core (CTRC), these in-laboratory studies utilize high-quality equipment to capture a comprehensive set of physiological measures essential for diagnosing and analyzing sleep disorders. The PSG system records data from various physiological signals, including:

-   **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** Electrodes placed on the scalp measure brain activity to assess sleep stages.
-   **EOG (Electrooculogram):** Measures eye movements, which are used to differentiate between sleep stages such as REM and non-REM sleep.
-   **EMG (Electromyogram):** Electrodes on the chin and legs record muscle activity, helping to identify movements during sleep.
-   **ECG (Electrocardiogram):** Records heart rate and rhythm to assess any cardiac disturbances during sleep.
-   **Snore Microphone:** Detects the presence of snoring, a common symptom of sleep apnea.
-   **Airflow:** Measured using a Dymedix nasal-oral thermistor, which captures the airflow through the nose and mouth.
-   **Nasal Pressure:** Measured by a Pro-Tech nasal pressure transducer to assess airflow and detect apneas or hypopneas.
-   **Breathing Effort:** Captured using a Pro-Tech zRIP inductance plethysmography summation system, which monitors respiratory effort and detects obstructions in airflow.
-   **Oxygen Saturation:** Monitored with an Ohmeda 3900 oximeter that uses a 3-second averaging rate to measure oxygen levels in the blood.

These measurements allow for a comprehensive analysis of sleep patterns, breathing events, and cardiovascular health, enabling researchers to investigate the causes and consequences of sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea. The PSG data collected from the WSC study has been critical in exploring the relationship between sleep disturbances and various health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease and metabolic disorders. The quality and variety of the data collected make it an invaluable resource for both clinical and research purposes.

### PSG Scoring

The polysomnography (PSG) scoring process for the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort (WSC) combines manual scoring with automated tools to ensure precision and reliability. Certified sleep technologists, trained in American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) criteria, manually score sleep stages, respiratory events, and limb movements, supported by automated software such as Compumedics Profusion PSG for pre-processing and initial annotations.

Sleep staging follows detailed guidelines: Stage 1 is scored when alpha activity decreases to less than 50% of the epoch and is replaced by low-voltage, mixed-frequency activity. Stage 2 requires the presence of spindles or K-complexes, with intervening epochs scored as Stage 2 unless the interval without these features exceeds 3 minutes. Stage 3 requires at least 20% but not more than 50% high-amplitude waves of 2 Hz or slower, while Stage 4 is scored when over 50% of the epoch consists of such waves with amplitudes exceeding 75 μV. Apneas are scored when airflow decreases by more than 80% for at least 10 seconds, as detected in nasal pressure and thermistor signals, with effort assessed using Respitrace channels. These are categorized as obstructive, central, or mixed based on the presence or absence of respiratory effort. Hypopneas are identified by a discernible reduction in nasal pressure or thermistor flow exceeding 50%, or less than 50% if associated with a 4% oxygen desaturation. Events must begin in sleep, and desaturation must occur within 30 seconds of the respiratory event, lasting no longer than 120 seconds. Leg movements are scored if they last between 0.5 and 5.0 seconds, have an amplitude of at least 50% of the subject's voluntary leg flexion, and occur during sleep epochs. Movements separated by at least 4 seconds are counted as separate events, and those associated with arousals are marked as LMA. All automated annotations undergo thorough manual review to ensure consistency, particularly for complex or borderline cases, supported by a rigorous quality control process. This robust scoring methodology ensures the accuracy and reliability of data essential for the WSC study.

### Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT)

Multiple Sleep Latency Tests (MSLT) were conducted from 1989 to 2011. Research MSLTs were administered from 1989- 2003. Clinical MSLTs were administered from 2001-2011. Sleep protocols and number of Naps differs by type of MSLT. Invitation criteria and scoring rules evolved over time.
