# About

The [Wisconsin Sleep Cohort (WSC)](https://pophealth.wisc.edu/research/the-wisconsin-sleep-cohort/) is an ongoing longitudinal study of the causes, consequences, and natural history of sleep disorders, particularly sleep apnea. The WSC uses overnight in-laboratory sleep studies (in-patient studies at the University of Wisconsin - Madison ICTR's CTRC) conducted with a baseline sample of 1,500 Wisconsin state employees, assessed at four-year intervals.

With approximately 100 publications, the WSC study has produced seminal findings on the wide prevalence of sleep apnea; the longitudinal association of sleep apnea with cardiovascular, mental health, and mortality outcomes; and risk factors for sleep disorders including weight gain, the menopausal transition, and alcohol use. The WSC also maintains multiple national and international collaborations related to basic science and population-level sleep research, including partnerships with groups at Stanford, the University of Chicago, Harvard, Toronto, the UK, Poland, France, and others.

The National Sleep Research Resource is grateful to the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort for sharing these data.
